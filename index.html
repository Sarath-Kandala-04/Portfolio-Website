                    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
                    <p>I'm Sai Sarath Kandala, a dedicated student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Technology at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. With a solid foundation in Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and SQL, I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I've achieved notable academic success, maintaining an impressive CGPA of 8.65 while completing projects in web development and Android app development.</p>
                    <p>My projects include a bus reservation website focusing on front-end design and a happy birthday greeting card developed in Kotlin for Android. These experiences have not only showcased my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to learning and innovation. Outside of academics, I enjoy reading manga, fiction novels, and self-help books, as well as indulging my interests in anime, video games, and automobiles.</p>
                    <p>In the future, I aspire to contribute to impactful projects and continue my journey of growth and learning, both personally and professionally.</p>
