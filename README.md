# Portfolio-website

A portfolio website is a digital platform that showcases an individual's professional work, projects, and skills. It typically contains sections highlighting the creator's background, experience, and education, along with a portfolio showcasing their best projects and accomplishments.

In the above file you are free to change and customize according to your portfolio in both the css and html files, even the picture of your choice :)
